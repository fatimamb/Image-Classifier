# Image Classifier Project

### Project Description

This project is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 
In this project, I have train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. 
The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

### Data:

The data used are a flower database, It is not provided in the repository as it's larger than what GitHub allows, but you can download it from the  
The data is divided into 3 folders:

- test
- train
- validate
